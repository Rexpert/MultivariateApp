# MultivariateApp
An app purposely built to demonstrate 3D coordinate system in my Multivariate Calculus class.

Website: https://rexpert.shinyapps.io/Multivariate/

This shiny app was built using shiny dashboard. It was built to show the application of 3D coordinate systems: 
1. Cartesian Coordinate System
2. Cylinder Coordinate System
3. Spherical Coordinate System
